## Tree-based Weekly Frequency Equity Selection Model
A panel data set (see data.csv) is provided with [date, identifier, market-cap,
sector and index-membership] as meta-information. 

The dataset contains a target variable ("target") that indicates the total return of the stocks over the next 28 calendar days.
In addition, a selection of 10 firm-specific features derived from price and fundamental data is
available to help predict the return of individual stocks.
